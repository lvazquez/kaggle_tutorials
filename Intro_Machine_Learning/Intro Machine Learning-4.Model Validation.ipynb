    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "You've built a model. But how good is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn to use model validation to measure the quality of your model. Measuring model quality is the key to iteratively improving your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Model Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll want to evaluate almost every model you ever build. In most (though not all) applications, the relevant measure of model quality is predictive accuracy. In other words, will the model's predictions be close to what actually happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people make a huge mistake when measuring predictive accuracy. They make predictions with their training data and compare those predictions to the target values in the training data. You'll see the problem with this approach and how to solve it in a moment, but let's think about how we'd do this first.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'd first need to summarize the model quality into an understandable way. If you compare predicted and actual home values for 10,000 houses, you'll likely find mix of good and bad predictions. Looking through a list of 10,000 predicted and actual values would be pointless. We need to summarize this into a single metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many metrics for summarizing model quality, but we'll start with one called **Mean Absolute Error** (also called **MAE**). Let's break down this metric starting with the last word, error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction error for each house is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "error = actual âˆ’ predicted\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if a house cost $150,000 and you predicted it would cost $100,000 the error is $50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the **MAE** metric, we take the absolute value of each error. This converts each error to a positive number. We then take the average of those absolute errors. This is our measure of model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English, it can be said as\n",
    "> On average, our predictions are off by about X.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate **MAE**, we first need a model. That is built in the cell below:"

    "## The Problem with \"In-Sample\" Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "The measure we just computed can be called an \"**in-sample**\" score. We used a single \"sample\" of houses for both building the model and evaluating it. Here's why this is bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that, in the large real estate market, door color is unrelated to home price.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the sample of data you used to build the model, all homes with green doors were very expensive. The model's job is to find patterns that predict home prices, so it will see this pattern, and it will always predict high prices for homes with green doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this pattern was derived from the training data, the model will appear accurate in the training data. But if this pattern doesn't hold when the model sees new data, the model would be very inaccurate when used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since models' practical value come from making predictions on new data, **we need to measure performance on data that wasn't used to build the model**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to do this is to exclude some data from the model-building process, and then use those to test the model's accuracy on data it hasn't seen before. This data is called **validation data**.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, it's not uncommon for a tree to have 10 splits between the top level (all houses) and a leaf. As the tree gets deeper, the dataset gets sliced up into leaves with fewer houses. If a tree only had 1 split, it divides the data into 2 groups. If each group is split again, we would get 4 groups of houses. Splitting each of those again would create 8 groups. If we keep doubling the number of groups by adding more splits at each level, we'll have $2^{10}$ groups of houses by the time we get to the 10th level. That's 1024 leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting\n",
    "When we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf. Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values, but they may make very unreliable predictions for new data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a phenomenon called **overfitting**, where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, if we make our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups. At an extreme, if a tree divides houses into only 2 or 4, each group still has a wide variety of houses. Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called **underfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we care about accuracy on new data, which we estimate from our validation data, we want to find the sweet spot between **underfitting** and **overfitting**. Visually, we want the low point of the (red) validation curve in the graph bellow:\n",

    "There are a few alternatives for controlling the tree depth, and many allow for some routes through the tree to have greater depth than other routes.

The more leaves we allow the model to make, the more we move from the underfitting area in the above graph to the overfitting area.\n",
